# Applied Machine Learning (AML)
This repository contains the Assignments of my `Applied Machine Learning (AML)` in 4th semester(Jan-May)

## **Assignment 01 - SMS spam classification**
 This project is an end-to-end SMS spam classification pipeline, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. Multiple models were used (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) each are benchmarked using Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score,etc to select the best-performing classifier.

## **Assignment 02 – Experiment Tracking & Version Control**

This project implements a reproducible Machine Learning pipeline using **DVC for data version control** and **MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning**. Multiple dataset splits were generated using different random seeds and tracked with DVC, while three benchmark models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) were trained and evaluated using AUCPR. All experiments and model versions were logged and registered to ensure full reproducibility and traceability.
